# Deepwork

Deepwork is an orchestrator workflow for heavy coding sessions: multiple
dependent phases, cross-cutting architectural change, unsafe-to-partially-ship
migration, or sustained coordination across specialist lanes. Never infer it
merely because a task touches multiple files; skip it for trivial edits, quick
docs changes, simple bug fixes, or routine bounded features.

## Core Contract

When deepwork is active, the orchestrator must manage the work as a scheduler,
not as the default implementation worker.

## Setup and Deepwork State

- keep live execution status in the Todo; when a durable handoff is useful, save a decision/evidence snapshot under `.slim/deepwork/`, not a second continuously synchronized checklist;
- save code/doc deliverables to project paths (e.g. `src/`, `docs/`); reserve
  `.slim/deepwork/` strictly for progress files;

### Deepwork File

The activation prompt pins one progress file per session:
`.slim/deepwork/<session-id>.md`, updated in place across turns; re-running
`/deepwork` in the same session reuses it. Never create or modify another
session's file. First line: `status: active`, flipped to `status: completed`
when the work concludes. On resume or after compaction, re-read it before
acting — it is the authoritative record of decisions, phases, and findings.

Before creating this file—and before planning or delegation—inspect the existing
`.gitignore` and `.ignore` and add only missing entries: `.gitignore` must
contain `.slim/deepwork/`; `.ignore` must contain `!.slim/deepwork/` and
`!.slim/deepwork/**`. This keeps deepwork state git-local yet OpenCode-readable.

Do not follow a rigid template. Choose whatever markdown structure best fits the
work. The file only needs to remain useful as persistent session state and should
capture, as applicable:

- current goal and understanding;
- researched, factual context from `@librarian` to avoid oracle doing its own
  research;
- plan drafts, Oracle review budget/gates, and review notes;
- implementation phases and status;
- validation results;
- unresolved questions, blockers, and follow-ups.

Refresh this snapshot at meaningful handoff or recovery boundaries. Record
accepted findings and original references rather than duplicating the Todo or
source bodies. A snapshot's age must be visible; consult the live execution
state before resuming work.

## Planning

- before dispatch, choose a small number of coherent implementation phases from
  the work's dependencies and natural delivery boundaries; do not split work
  merely to reduce an Oracle review's scope;
- schedule `@oracle` reviews from the work's goal and risk, not one mechanical
  gate per phase; where accepted research or a prior review's evidence is still
  valid for a phase, reference it instead of scheduling a fresh gate for
  unchanged ground. Each scheduled gate keeps the 1 + 2 review budget below.
  Record the phase order, specialist ownership, gate order, and one-line gate
  rationale in the deepwork file; share a compact version with the user;

## Phase Execution

- before each implementation phase, decide the execution path: what can run in
  parallel, what must be sequential, which specialists to delegate to, and
  whether to split the same agent into multiple bounded lanes;

### Scheduler Discipline

Use the scheduler model throughout:

- record task/session IDs and ownership boundaries;
- wait for hook-driven background completion before consuming background results;
- avoid blocking Orchestrator lane while background jobs run; if no independent
  work remains, stop briefly and let the completion event resume the workflow;
- do not advance to the next phase while relevant jobs are running or terminal
  results are unreconciled.

## Phase Gate and Commit

- after each planned phase, run relevant validation, update the deepwork file,
  then request its planned `@oracle` gate before continuing;
- before its planned Oracle gate, record in the deepwork file the phase goal,
  changed paths, validation evidence, the specific decision or risk to review,
  and accepted research with file references, so Oracle reviews established
  context rather than repeating discovery;
- when the phase changes module boundaries, dependency direction, or file
  placement, run an `@explorer` structure scan in parallel with the Oracle gate;
- reconcile review findings, perform one bounded remediation pass for material
  issues, including simplify/readability feedback, and validate that pass with
  focused evidence;
- when the user requests checkpoints or integration, propose a focused commit
  at an independently valid delivery boundary and create it only with explicit
  authorization. Otherwise continue verified work without adding a commit
  approval gate; deepwork never commits on its own initiative;

### Oracle Re-Reviews

Every planned Oracle gate has one initial review and may have at most two
re-reviews. Request a re-review only when the remediation materially changes
the reviewed decision or risk, or when the original concern cannot be verified
with focused evidence. Do not spend a re-review on a mechanical or
already-verified change.

State the attempt in every Oracle prompt, for example:

```text
Gate 2 — review attempt 2 of 3 (1 re-review remaining)
```

For re-reviews, tell Oracle to prioritize unresolved material findings, risks
introduced by remediation, and whether prior findings are resolved. It must not
reopen accepted, unchanged, or resolved concerns. When the two re-reviews are
exhausted, record any remaining material risk or blocker in the deepwork file
and ask the user whether to accept the risk, change scope, or authorize an
exceptional additional review.

## Designer Handoff Guardrail

When a deepwork phase includes `@designer`, treat the delivered UI/UX as
accepted design intent for later phases. Record any important design decisions in
the deepwork file before continuing.

After designer work:

- preserve layout, rhythm, hierarchy, motion, spacing, color, affordances,
  responsiveness, and component feel;
- review and improve user-facing copy with grounded, normal wording, but do not
  change visual structure or interaction intent;
- route follow-up visual, responsive, motion, hierarchy, polish, or
  component-feel changes back to `@designer`;
- use `@fixer` only for bounded mechanical follow-up that preserves the design
  exactly, such as wiring, tests, type fixes, or non-visual behavior changes;
- if design intent must change, record why in the deepwork file before changing
  it.

## Completion

- finish with final validation and a concise summary.
